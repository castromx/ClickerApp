# Clicker Game with Telegram Bot Integration

This project is a clicker game with a graphical interface, accessible via a Telegram bot, allowing play on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Game Features

- **Graphical Interface**: Built with the Flet library, the game's main interactive element is a clickable coin image. Each click increases the score counter.
- **Animations and Progress Bar**: Clicking the coin triggers animations, and the progress bar fills up with each click, resetting every 100 points. A "+100" message appears with each reset.
  
## Telegram Bot Integration

The Telegram bot, developed using Aiogram, lets users play the game directly through Telegram:
- **Start Command**: Begins interaction with the bot.
- **"Let's Click!" Button**: Opens the game's web app via a provided URL, allowing users to play on any device, desktop or mobile.
